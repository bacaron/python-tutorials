    "# Introduction to python and coding statistics using tract profile data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is designed to introduce basic python programming concepts including module importing, data structures, loading of data, manipulating data, computing simple summary statistics, and generating plots. We will walk through these concepts by working with the tract profile data of all 42 subjects from 'Advanced mapping of the human white matter microstructure better separates elite sports participation' (https://brainlife.io/pub/5f2c3765beafe924c962dd8d).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Module import\n",
    "Software packages in python can be loaded into python as \"modules\". Loading a module is pretty simple, however there are a few specifics to note.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import entire module\n",
    "Entire software packages can be loaded in a single line of code. In order to use these packages, they first must be loaded into the python environment. To load and manipulate the tract profile data later, we will want to load a few software packages. Specifically, pandas, numpy, matplotlib. Pandas is a software package that loads data as \"dataframes\", and is extremely useful for performing statistical analyses on .csv files (like the ones for tract profiles). Numpy is a package that allows for matrix and high-dimensional array mathematics. Matplotlib and seaborn are extremely useful packages for generating plots and figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, modules can be imported into the python environment by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "\timport <software package name>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also specify the name of a module, usually to something shorter (we're all lazy), using this format:\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\timport <software package name> as <name you want to use>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the basics are covered, let's import the packages we need:"

    "### Import submodule\n",
    "It is also possible to just import single scripts from a software package as a 'submodule'. This can be done in a single line of code as well, but requires a slightly different format:\n",

    "\timport <software package name>.<script name>\n",

    "\t\n",
    "\tfrom <software package name> import <script name>\n",

    "Now that we've loaded the software that we need, we move on to a brief explanation of data structures!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data structures\n",
    "In all programming languages, data is stored in memory in a specific \"data structure\". A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are many different types of data structures that all have a specific organization. Some data structures include: lists, arrays, dictionaries, and dataframes (to name a few). For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll focus specifically on lists and dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists\n",
    "A list is a data structure that holds an ordered collection of items i.e. you can store a sequence of items in a list (https://python.swaroopch.com/data_structures.html). Lists are great for storing strings (i.e. text).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I can create a list of state names by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tstate_names = ['Indiana','Michigan','Ohio','Kentucky']\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can also include numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tnumbers = [1,2,3,4]\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists will be extremely helpful later when writing your own code, especially in regards to a functionality called 'list comprehension'. We'll get to that later (much later).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data frames\n",
    "Another data structure of interest for us is the data frame. A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. You can think of it like a spreadsheet or SQL table, or a dict of Series objects (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html). Data frames are really useful when your data has a organized structure, like csv files. The data frame is the foundation of pandas, and is quite important for our statistical analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've gone over a few data structures, let's go over how to load our data into a dataframe using pandas!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading data\n",
    "Loading data takes a variety of forms, depending on the datatype and how you want to interact with the data. For this tutorial, we will go over how to load a .csv (excel) file with tract profile data using pandas. Pandas is an incredibly powerful package for dealing with large, structured csv files. It is also quite a user-friendly package and has lots of information online regarding how to use it and troubleshooting issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading in csv data from a file is very easy with pandas with the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tdf = pd.read_csv(<filepath to the csv file>)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: df == dataframe.\n",
    "\n",

    "Now that we have the data loaded, we can start doing some simple manipulation of the data to understand the structure better.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Manipulating data with pandas\n",
    "With pandas, and other data structures in python, manipulating data is quite easy (and fun) once a few simple syntax-related concepts are covered. We'll go over some basics in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Obtaining column names (keys)\n",
    "In order to better understand the structure of your data, you need to know how the columns are labelled. There are a few ways to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. printing the table\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple, but less elegant, way to understand the data structure is to print the data. This can be done by simply entering the name of your dataframe:"

    "We see a few rows including 'anteriorFrontalCC' and 'righttemporoThalamic'. How can we get all of the tract names? By using the 'unique' function. This function will only print out the unique names, and ignore the repeats of those name. Since there are 180 nodes x track, 61 tracks per subject, and 42 subjects, these names repeat quite frequently. The unique function can save us from the repeats. With pandas, we can do that by running the following:"
